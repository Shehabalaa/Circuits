if there are some Nodes connect to ground those Nodes are one Nodes

so they should be taken as one input node and tha name of this node will always be Node0

and user shoul enter this node after entering all nodes

this groundnode will be treated as refernce node if you user want Voltage of a Node in curcuit 

otherwise if this groundnode doesnot exist the user will have two options

1.Seletct any node as reference(ground)
2.let program to select any node automaticly 
Node:SencondOption wonot be good if user want a votage of node as ref. will be randomy taken
and of course another outputs wonot be effected as current or power etc.
